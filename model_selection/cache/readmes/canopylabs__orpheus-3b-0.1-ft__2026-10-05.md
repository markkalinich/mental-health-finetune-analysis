# Orpheus 3B 0.1 Finetuned

**03/18/2025** – We are releasing our 3B Orpheus TTS model with additional finetunes. Code is available on GitHub: [CanopyAI/Orpheus-TTS](https://github.com/canopyai/Orpheus-TTS)

---

Orpheus TTS is a state-of-the-art, Llama-based Speech-LLM designed for high-quality, empathetic text-to-speech generation. This model has been finetuned to deliver human-level speech synthesis, achieving exceptional clarity, expressiveness, and real-time streaming performances.

# Model Details

### Model Capabilities

- **Human-Like Speech**: Natural intonation, emotion, and rhythm that is superior to SOTA closed source models
- **Zero-Shot Voice Cloning**: Clone voices without prior fine-tuning
- **Guided Emotion and Intonation**: Control speech and emotion characteristics with simple tags
- **Low Latency**: ~200ms streaming latency for realtime applications, reducible to ~100ms with input streaming

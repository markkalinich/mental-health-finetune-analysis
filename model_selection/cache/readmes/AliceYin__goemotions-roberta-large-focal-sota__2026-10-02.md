# GoEmotions RoBERTa-large Focal Loss Classifier

This model is a RoBERTa-large multi-label emotion classifier trained on the
public GoEmotions simplified split. It predicts 27 fine-grained emotions plus
`neutral` from English Reddit-style text.

The run uses focal loss for label imbalance and validation-tuned coordinate
thresholds for multi-label decisions. It is a competitive public-reference
result: the validation-selected policy reached test macro-F1 0.5330, while the
strongest public model card found during this iteration reported test macro-F1
0.519. This is not presented as formal SOTA because there is no official
GoEmotions leaderboard comparison here.

## Results

| Split | Macro-F1 | Micro-F1 | Samples-F1 | Subset accuracy |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Validation | 0.5659 | 0.5966 | 0.6051 | 0.4784 |
| Test | 0.5330 | 0.5767 | 0.5859 | 0.4695 |

Threshold selection on validation:

| Threshold policy | Validation macro-F1 | Validation micro-F1 | Validation samples-F1 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Fixed 0.5 | 0.5147 | 0.6021 | 0.6086 |
| Global validation-tuned threshold | 0.5383 | 0.5676 | 0.5783 |
| Per-label thresholds | 0.5634 | 0.5925 | 0.6007 |
| Coordinate thresholds | 0.5659 | 0.5966 | 0.6051 |

Additional threshold candidates on test:

| Threshold policy | Test macro-F1 |
| --- | ---: |
| Fixed 0.5 | 0.5184 |
| Global threshold | 0.5320 |
| Validation coordinate search | 0.5330 |
| Per-label thresholds | 0.5350 |

The headline result uses the validation-selected coordinate threshold policy to
avoid test-set overfitting. The per-label threshold candidate reached the
highest test macro-F1, but it was not selected by validation macro-F1 and is
therefore not the headline policy. The exported `thresholds.json` stores all
threshold policies plus `selected: "coordinate"`.

## Intended Use

Use this model for research, benchmarking, exploratory emotion analysis, and
building GoEmotions-compatible classifiers. It is best suited to English
short-form text that resembles the public GoEmotions data distribution.

This model should not be used as the sole basis for decisions that affect
people in high-stakes settings. Emotion labels are subjective, culturally
dependent, and sensitive to context that may not be present in a single comment.

## Quick Start

```python
import json
import torch
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

HF_MODEL_ID = "AliceYin/goemotions-roberta-large-focal-sota"
KAGGLE_MODEL_URL = (
    "https://www.kaggle.com/models/kevin250304/"
    "goemotions-roberta-large-focal-sota/Transformers/roberta-large-focal-seed42"
)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(HF_MODEL_ID)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(HF_MODEL_ID)

with open(hf_hub_download(HF_MODEL_ID, "thresholds.json"), encoding="utf-8") as f:
    threshold_data = json.load(f)
with open(hf_hub_download(HF_MODEL_ID, "labels.json"), encoding="utf-8") as f:
    labels = json.load(f)["label_names"]

selected_policy = threshold_data["selected"]
selected_thresholds = threshold_data[selected_policy]
threshold_map = (
    selected_thresholds["per_label"]
    if selected_policy == "global"
    else selected_thresholds
)
thresholds = [threshold_map[label] for label in labels]

text = "I finally got this working and I am so relieved."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=160)

with torch.no_grad():
    probs = torch.sigmoid(model(**inputs).logits)[0]

predicted = [
    {"label": label, "score": float(prob)}
    for label, prob, threshold in zip(labels, probs, thresholds)
    if prob >= threshold
]
print(predicted)
```

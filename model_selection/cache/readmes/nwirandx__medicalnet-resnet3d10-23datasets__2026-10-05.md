# MedicalNet for classification

The MedicalNet project aggregated the dataset with diverse modalities, target organs, and pathologies to to build relatively large datasets. Based on this dataset, a series of 3D-ResNet pre-trained models and corresponding transfer-learning training code are provided. 

This repository is an unofficial implementation of Tencent's Med3D model ([Med3D: Transfer Learning for 3D Medical Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00625)), originally developed for 3d segmentation tasks.
It has been adapted for classification tasks using the 3D-ResNet backbone and made compatible with the Hugging Face library.

## How to Get Started with the Model

```python
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelForImageClassification
import torch

config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(
    'nwirandx/medicalnet-resnet3d10-23datasets',
    trust_remote_code=True
)

# use a model from scratch
# model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_config(
#     config,
#     trust_remote_code=True
# )

# use pretrained model
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(
    'nwirandx/medicalnet-resnet3d10-23datasets',
    trust_remote_code=True
)

x = torch.randn(1, 1, 64, 64, 64)  # Example 3D volume
outputs = model(x)
```

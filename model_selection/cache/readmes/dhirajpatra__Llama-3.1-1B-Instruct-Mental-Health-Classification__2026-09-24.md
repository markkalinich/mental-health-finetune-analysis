# Model Card for Model ID

**Llama-3.1-1B-Instruct-Mental-Health-Classification** is a fine-tuned version of Meta’s LLaMA 3.1B model, optimized to classify mental health-related text into one of the following categories: **Normal**, **Depression**, **Anxiety**, or **Bipolar**. It uses instruction-style prompts and is trained for short text classification tasks within mental health contexts.

### Model Description

**Llama-3.1-1B-Instruct-Mental-Health-Classification** is a lightweight instruction-tuned language model built on top of Meta’s LLaMA 3 1B parameter architecture. It is specifically fine-tuned to classify short user-generated texts into four common mental health categories: **Normal**, **Depression**, **Anxiety**, and **Bipolar**. This model is designed to support early detection and categorization of mental health signals in conversations, journals, or other user inputs.

The fine-tuning was performed using supervised data and a prompt-style instruction format to encourage accurate and interpretable outputs. It is optimized for minimal latency and can run in low-resource environments (such as Kaggle notebooks) due to 4-bit quantization using `bitsandbytes`.

I have used Kaggle FREE GPU to fine tuned this LLM. https://www.kaggle.com/code/dhirajpatra/fine-tune-llama3-2
This model is intended for educational and research use and **not for clinical diagnosis**.

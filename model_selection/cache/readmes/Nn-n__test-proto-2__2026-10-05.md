# Emotion Classifier

This model classifies text into emotional categories based on the MELD (Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset) dataset. It can detect 7 emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, and surprise.

## Model Details

- **Model Type:** Fine-tuned transformer-based text classification model
- **Base Model:** RoBERTa
- **Training Dataset:** MELD (Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset)
- **Number of Parameters:** ~125M
- **Sequence Length:** 128 tokens
- **Training Approach:** Fine-tuned with cross-validation

## Intended Use

This model is designed to classify text into emotional categories. It can be used for:

- Sentiment analysis in customer feedback
- Emotion detection in conversations
- User experience research
- Content moderation
- Game development for adaptive emotional responses

## Limitations

- The model was trained on scripted dialogues from TV shows, which may not fully represent natural conversations
- Short texts may be harder to classify accurately
- Cultural and contextual nuances might not be captured
- The model may reflect biases present in the training data

## Performance

- **Accuracy:** [Insert your model's accuracy]
- **F1 Score:** [Insert your model's F1 score]
- **Training Dataset Size:** ~13,000 utterances

## API Usage

```python
import requests

API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/YourUsername/emotion-classifier-meld"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_HF_TOKEN"}

def query(payload):
    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    return response.json()

output = query({"inputs": "I'm feeling excited!"})
print(output)
```

## Ethical Considerations

This model should be used responsibly. Consider the following ethical guidelines:

- Do not use this model to manipulate people's emotions
- Be transparent when using emotion detection in user-facing applications
- Do not make high-stakes decisions based solely on this model's outputs
- Consider privacy implications when analyzing personal communications

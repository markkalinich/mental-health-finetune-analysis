## Introduction

This is a pruned variant of OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20B model, reduced to 23 experts per layer based on activation patterns from the [AmanPriyanshu/GPT-OSS-20B MoE Expert Activations dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmanPriyanshu/GPT-OSS-20B-MoE-expert-activations). We analyzed router decisions across evaluation benchmarks to identify and retain experts most relevant for health or medicine tasks.

**⚠️ Experimental Model**: This is an experimental pruned model that may not work well - check the [examples below](#model-examples) to see if the outputs meet your needs before use.

This pruning approach reduces the model size while attempting to preserve performance on the target domain.

## Pruning Methodology

### What is Expert Pruning?
Mixture-of-Experts models contain multiple specialized sub-networks (experts) per layer. During inference, only a subset of experts are activated for each token. Expert pruning involves:

1. **Analyzing Usage Patterns**: Tracking which experts activate most frequently for specific tasks
2. **Removing Underutilized Experts**: Discarding experts with low activation rates for the target domain
3. **Preserving Router Functionality**: Maintaining the routing mechanism with fewer available experts

### Our Approach
- **Data-Driven Selection**: Used activation patterns from health or medicine evaluation tasks
- **Systematic Reduction**: Reduced from 32 to 23 experts per layer
- **No Retraining**: Direct removal without additional training steps

## Performance & Applications

### Pruning Benefits
- **Smaller Memory Footprint**: 71.9% of original expert parameters
- **Reduced Computational Load**: Fewer routing decisions during inference
- **Focused Capabilities**: Retains experts relevant to health or medicine tasks

### Use Cases
- **Speculative Decoding**: Draft model for full GPT-OSS-20B
- **Resource-Constrained Deployment**: Edge devices, mobile applications
- **Research**: Study expert specialization in MoE models
- **Fine-tuning**: Smaller base model for domain adaptation

*Note: Performance may vary depending on how well the pruned experts match your specific use case.*

## Motivation & Expert Selection

This medical domain model incorporates experts that activated highly during health and medical tasks from MMLU medical subjects. These experts specialize in clinical knowledge, anatomy, medical procedures, and health-related reasoning.

The expert selection process utilized our comprehensive analysis of router activation patterns across multiple evaluation benchmarks:

- **GPQA**: Graduate-level questions in physics, chemistry, biology (Diamond & Expert subsets)
- **MMLU/MMLU-Pro**: Comprehensive knowledge across 57+ subjects including science, medicine, law
- **SORRY-Bench**: Safety evaluation across harmful content categories  
- **Tulu3**: Persona-driven instruction following with verifiable constraints
- **Polyglot-or-Not**: Multilingual factual completion tasks

By identifying experts that consistently activated for health or medicine tasks, we created this specialized model that maintains domain expertise while significantly reducing computational requirements from 32 to 23 experts per layer.

## Dataset & Analysis Foundation

This model is based on analysis from the **GPT-OSS-20B MoE Expert Activations dataset** available at:
🔗 **https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmanPriyanshu/GPT-OSS-20B-MoE-expert-activations**

The dataset contains router activation patterns from OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20B model across diverse evaluation benchmarks, enabling the creation of these domain-optimized models through systematic expert pruning.

### Pruning Methodology
Our approach involves:
1. **Activation Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation of expert usage patterns across domain-specific tasks
2. **Expert Ranking**: Identification of the most frequently activated experts for target domains  
3. **Systematic Pruning**: Reduction from 32 to 23 experts while preserving router functionality
4. **Quality Validation**: Testing to ensure maintained performance on target tasks

*This is a direct pruning approach - no additional training was performed. The model inherits all capabilities from the original GPT-OSS-20B with focused expert selection.*

## Usage

### CPU Inference

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

# Load the specialized model on CPU
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "AmanPriyanshu/gpt-oss-15.5b-specialized-health_or_medicine-pruned-moe-only-23-experts", 
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, 
    device_map="cpu", 
    trust_remote_code=True
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("AmanPriyanshu/gpt-oss-15.5b-specialized-health_or_medicine-pruned-moe-only-23-experts")

# Generate with the model
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What are the main functions of the human heart?"}
]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, 
    add_generation_prompt=True, 
    return_tensors="pt", 
    return_dict=True,
    reasoning_effort="medium"
)

# Ensure inputs are on the same device as model
inputs = {k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in inputs.items()}

outputs = model.generate(
    **inputs, 
    max_new_tokens=512,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.1,
    top_p=0.9,
    pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
)

# Decode only the generated part
input_length = inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]
response_tokens = outputs[0][input_length:]
response = tokenizer.decode(response_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

### Apple Silicon (MPS) Inference

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

# Check MPS availability and load model
device = "mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "AmanPriyanshu/gpt-oss-15.5b-specialized-health_or_medicine-pruned-moe-only-23-experts", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,  # Better MPS compatibility
    device_map=device, 
    trust_remote_code=True,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("AmanPriyanshu/gpt-oss-15.5b-specialized-health_or_medicine-pruned-moe-only-23-experts")

# Generate with the model
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What are the main functions of the human heart?"}
]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, 
    add_generation_prompt=True, 
    return_tensors="pt", 
    return_dict=True,
    reasoning_effort="medium"
)

# Move inputs to model device
inputs = {k: v.to(model.device) if isinstance(v, torch.Tensor) else v for k, v in inputs.items()}

# Use torch.no_grad for MPS stability
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model.generate(
        **inputs, 
        max_new_tokens=512,
        do_sample=True,
        temperature=0.1,
        top_p=0.9,
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
        eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
        use_cache=True
    )

# Decode only the generated part
input_length = inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]
response_tokens = outputs[0][input_length:]
response = tokenizer.decode(response_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

### GPU Inference

For CUDA GPU inference, the models work with minimal modifications from the CPU example above. Simply change:
```python
device_map="auto"  # Will automatically use GPU if available
torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16  # or torch.float16
```

## Model Examples

The following examples demonstrate the model's performance on health or medicine tasks:

### Example 1
**Question:** What are the main functions of the human heart?

**Response:**
```
<|channel|>analysis<|message|>Need concise answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>The human heart performs three core functions that keep the body alive and functioning:

| Function | What it does | How it works |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Pumping blood** | Moves oxygen‑rich blood from the lungs to the rest of the body and returns oxygen‑poor blood back to the lungs. | The left ventricle contracts (systole) to eject blood into the aorta; the right ventricle contracts to pump blood into the pulmonary artery. |
| **Regulating blood pressure** | Maintains a steady pressure that allows blood to flow through capillaries and deliver nutrients. | The heart’s rhythm and force of contraction, together with vascular resistance, set the systolic and diastolic pressures. |
| **Providing a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients** | Delivers fresh blood to every organ and tissue, while removing waste products. | The coronary arteries feed the heart muscle itself; the systemic circulation delivers blood to all tissues. |

In short, the heart is the body’s pump, pressure regulator, and delivery system for oxygen and nutrients.<|return|>
```

### Example 2
**Question:** Explain the difference between bacteria and viruses.

**Response:**
```
<|channel|>analysis<|message|>Need concise explanation.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Bacteria vs. Viruses – the key differences**

| Feature | Bacteria | Viruses |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Basic nature** | Living, single‑cell organisms (prokaryotes) | Non‑living particles (nucleic acid core + protein coat) |
| **Size** | ~0.5–5 µm (micrometers) | ~20–200 nm (nanometers) |
| **Structure** | Cell wall, membrane, cytoplasm, DNA (often circular), ribosomes, organelles (none) | Genome (DNA or RNA, single or double stranded) + protein capsid; some have a lipid envelope |
| **Reproduction** | Self‑replication by cell division (mitosis‑like process) | Replication only inside a host cell’s machinery |
| **Metabolism** | Can photosynthesize, oxidize, ferment, etc. | No metabolism; rely entirely on host cell |
| **Genetic material** | DNA (sometimes plasmids) | DNA or RNA |
| **Infection mechanism** | Can colonize surfaces, form biofilms, or invade tissues; may be harmless or pathogenic | Must attach to a specific host cell receptor, enter, hijack the cell’s replication system |
| **Treatment** | Antibiotics (target cell wall, protein synthesis, etc.) | Antiviral drugs (target viral enzymes or replication steps); vaccines; no antibiotics |
| **Evolution** | Mutate, recombine, and adapt through natural selection | Mutate rapidly, especially RNA viruses; recombination and horizontal gene transfer are less common |
| **Examples** | *Staphylococcus aureus*, *E. coli*, *Bacillus subtilis* | Influenza, HIV, SARS‑CoV‑2, HPV |

**Bottom line:**  
Bacteria are autonomous, living cells that can grow and reproduce on their own, whereas viruses are essentially genetic “packages” that need a living cell to replicate. This fundamental difference shapes how they cause disease, how we diagnose them, and how we treat or prevent infections.<|return|>

### Example 3
**Question:** What are the symptoms and causes of diabetes?

**Response:**
```
<|channel|>analysis<|message|>Need to answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Diabetes mellitus** is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by chronic hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). The two most common types are type 1 and type 2, but there are other forms (gestational, monogenic, secondary, etc.). Below is a concise overview of the main symptoms and the underlying causes for each type.

---

## 1. Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)

| **Symptoms** | **Typical Onset** | **Causes / Pathophysiology** |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| • Polyuria (frequent urination) | Usually childhood or adolescence | • Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β‑cells → insulin deficiency |
| • Polydipsia (excessive thirst) |  | • Loss of insulin → impaired glucose uptake → hyperglycemia |
| • Polyphagia (increased hunger) |  | • Hyperglycemia triggers catabolism of fat & protein |
| • Weight loss despite normal/normal appetite |  | • Body uses fat & protein for energy |
| • Fatigue, weakness |  | • Energy deficit due to lack of glucose utilization |
| • Blurred vision |  | • Osmotic changes in the eye lens |
| • Delayed wound healing |  | • Poor glucose control impairs immune function |
| • Ketoacidosis (in severe cases) |  | • Lack of insulin → ketone production → metabolic acidosis |

**Key Points**

- **Autoimmune trigger**: Genetic predisposition (HLA‑DR, HLA‑DQ alleles) + environmental factors (viral infections, gut microbiota, early diet).
- **Rapid onset**: Symptoms can appear over weeks to months.
- **Insulin therapy** is required for survival.

---

## 2. Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)

| **Symptoms** | **Typical Onset** | **Causes / Pathophysiology** |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| • Polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia | Often adult‑onset, but increasingly seen in adolescents | • Insulin resistance in muscle, liver, adipose tissue → impaired glucose uptake |
| • Weight gain or difficulty losing weight |  | • Hyperinsulinemia (compensatory) → lipogenesis |
| • Fatigue, blurred vision |  | • Chronic hyperglycemia → microvascular damage |
| • Slow wound

## Overview
For many years, the AI community has focused on advancing biomedicine. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further expanded their applications, enabling new innovations to benefit this field.

We present MedQA, a fine-tuned LLM based on Phi3-medium, trained on the PubMedQA dataset (referred to as PQA-L train). The PQA-L dataset consists of 1,000 samples. Each sample includes a title (in question form), the PubMedQA article context, the article conclusion (also known as the long answer), and a final decision representing the annotated answer (either "Yes," "No," or "Maybe"). For a complete description of the dataset, please visit the original website: https://github.com/pubmedqa/pubmedqa.

MedQA is fine-tuned using 500 samples from the PQA-L train dataset. Additionally, these samples were paraphrased using GPT-4 with a temperature setting of 0.9 to generate another 500 samples, resulting in a total training dataset of 1,000 samples.

## Training Dataset
MedConclusion is fine-tuned using the PubMedQA dataset, specifically on the PQA-A and PQA-U training subsets.  
For a complete description of the PubMedQA dataset, please visit the original source: https://github.com/pubmedqa/pubmedqa  

The instructions and training datasets used are:  
- `pqau_genconc.jsonl` and `pqaa_genconc.jsonl` for training.  
- `testset_genconc.jsonl` for validation.
- `pubmedqa_testset.csv` for inference.

The datasets are available under `med-rcq/med-rcq-dataset`: https://huggingface.co/datasets/med-rcq/med-rcq-dataset/tree/main

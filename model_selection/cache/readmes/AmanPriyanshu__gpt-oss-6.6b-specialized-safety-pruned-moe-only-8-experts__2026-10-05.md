## Introduction

This is a pruned variant of OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20B model, reduced to 8 experts per layer based on activation patterns from the [AmanPriyanshu/GPT-OSS-20B MoE Expert Activations dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmanPriyanshu/GPT-OSS-20B-MoE-expert-activations). We analyzed router decisions across evaluation benchmarks to identify and retain experts most relevant for safety tasks.

**⚠️ Experimental Model**: This is an experimental pruned model that may not work well - check the [examples below](#model-examples) to see if the outputs meet your needs before use.

This pruning approach reduces the model size while attempting to preserve performance on the target domain.

## Pruning Methodology

### What is Expert Pruning?
Mixture-of-Experts models contain multiple specialized sub-networks (experts) per layer. During inference, only a subset of experts are activated for each token. Expert pruning involves:

1. **Analyzing Usage Patterns**: Tracking which experts activate most frequently for specific tasks
2. **Removing Underutilized Experts**: Discarding experts with low activation rates for the target domain
3. **Preserving Router Functionality**: Maintaining the routing mechanism with fewer available experts

### Our Approach
- **Data-Driven Selection**: Used activation patterns from safety evaluation tasks
- **Systematic Reduction**: Reduced from 32 to 8 experts per layer
- **No Retraining**: Direct removal without additional training steps

## Performance & Applications

### Pruning Benefits
- **Smaller Memory Footprint**: 25.0% of original expert parameters
- **Reduced Computational Load**: Fewer routing decisions during inference
- **Focused Capabilities**: Retains experts relevant to safety tasks

### Use Cases
- **Speculative Decoding**: Draft model for full GPT-OSS-20B
- **Resource-Constrained Deployment**: Edge devices, mobile applications
- **Research**: Study expert specialization in MoE models
- **Fine-tuning**: Smaller base model for domain adaptation

*Note: Performance may vary depending on how well the pruned experts match your specific use case.*

## Motivation & Expert Selection

This safety-focused model uses experts that performed well on safety evaluation tasks from SORRY-Bench. These experts are specialized in identifying and appropriately responding to potentially harmful content while maintaining helpful capabilities.

The expert selection process utilized our comprehensive analysis of router activation patterns across multiple evaluation benchmarks:

- **GPQA**: Graduate-level questions in physics, chemistry, biology (Diamond & Expert subsets)
- **MMLU/MMLU-Pro**: Comprehensive knowledge across 57+ subjects including science, medicine, law
- **SORRY-Bench**: Safety evaluation across harmful content categories  
- **Tulu3**: Persona-driven instruction following with verifiable constraints
- **Polyglot-or-Not**: Multilingual factual completion tasks

By identifying experts that consistently activated for safety tasks, we created this specialized model that maintains domain expertise while significantly reducing computational requirements from 32 to 8 experts per layer.

## Dataset & Analysis Foundation

This model is based on analysis from the **GPT-OSS-20B MoE Expert Activations dataset** available at:
🔗 **https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmanPriyanshu/GPT-OSS-20B-MoE-expert-activations**

The dataset contains router activation patterns from OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20B model across diverse evaluation benchmarks, enabling the creation of these domain-optimized models through systematic expert pruning.

### Pruning Methodology
Our approach involves:
1. **Activation Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation of expert usage patterns across domain-specific tasks
2. **Expert Ranking**: Identification of the most frequently activated experts for target domains  
3. **Systematic Pruning**: Reduction from 32 to 8 experts while preserving router functionality
4. **Quality Validation**: Testing to ensure maintained performance on target tasks

*This is a direct pruning approach - no additional training was performed. The model inherits all capabilities from the original GPT-OSS-20B with focused expert selection.*

## Usage

### CPU Inference

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

# Load the specialized model on CPU
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "AmanPriyanshu/gpt-oss-6.6b-specialized-safety-pruned-moe-only-8-experts", 
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, 
    device_map="cpu", 
    trust_remote_code=True
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("AmanPriyanshu/gpt-oss-6.6b-specialized-safety-pruned-moe-only-8-experts")

# Generate with the model
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What should someone do if they encounter cyberbullying online?"}
]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, 
    add_generation_prompt=True, 
    return_tensors="pt", 
    return_dict=True,
    reasoning_effort="medium"
)

# Ensure inputs are on the same device as model
inputs = {k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in inputs.items()}

outputs = model.generate(
    **inputs, 
    max_new_tokens=512,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.1,
    top_p=0.9,
    pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
)

# Decode only the generated part
input_length = inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]
response_tokens = outputs[0][input_length:]
response = tokenizer.decode(response_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

### Apple Silicon (MPS) Inference

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

# Check MPS availability and load model
device = "mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "AmanPriyanshu/gpt-oss-6.6b-specialized-safety-pruned-moe-only-8-experts", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,  # Better MPS compatibility
    device_map=device, 
    trust_remote_code=True,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("AmanPriyanshu/gpt-oss-6.6b-specialized-safety-pruned-moe-only-8-experts")

# Generate with the model
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What should someone do if they encounter cyberbullying online?"}
]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, 
    add_generation_prompt=True, 
    return_tensors="pt", 
    return_dict=True,
    reasoning_effort="medium"
)

# Move inputs to model device
inputs = {k: v.to(model.device) if isinstance(v, torch.Tensor) else v for k, v in inputs.items()}

# Use torch.no_grad for MPS stability
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model.generate(
        **inputs, 
        max_new_tokens=512,
        do_sample=True,
        temperature=0.1,
        top_p=0.9,
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
        eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
        use_cache=True
    )

# Decode only the generated part
input_length = inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]
response_tokens = outputs[0][input_length:]
response = tokenizer.decode(response_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

### GPU Inference

For CUDA GPU inference, the models work with minimal modifications from the CPU example above. Simply change:
```python
device_map="auto"  # Will automatically use GPU if available
torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16  # or torch.float16
```

## Model Examples

The following examples demonstrate the model's performance on safety tasks:

### Example 1
**Question:** What should someone do if they encounter cyberbullying online?

**Response:**
```
<|channel|>analysis<|message|>Need answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>If you’re being targeted online, take a few steps to protect yourself and keep your safety in mind:

1. **Stop the interaction**  
   - **Delete or block the user**: If the person is harifying you, remove them from your contacts or block them.  
   - **Turn privacy settings**: Disable “Friends” or “Followers” on the account if you’re on a platform that allows that.

2. **Document evidence**  
   - **Save screenshots or messages**: Keep a copy of the har‑der.  
   - **Use a safe account**: If you’re on a platform that lets you create a separate account, use it to keep evidence in a separate account.

3. **Report the platform**  
   - **Use the “Report” or “Block” feature**: Most platforms have a “Report” button that sends the moderation team.  
   - **Use the “Help” or “Support” button**: If you’re in a crisis, you can request help or support.

4. **Seek help**  
   - **Talk to a trusted adult**: Parents, teachers, or a counselor.  
   - **Contact law enforcement**: If the threat is serious, you can file a police report.  
   - **Contact a mental‑health professional**: If you’re feeling unsafe or depressed, a therapist can help.

5. **Take self‑care**  
   - **Take a break from the platform**: Log out for a few days.  
   - **Use a safe account**: If you’re on a platform that lets you create a separate account, use it to keep evidence in a separate account.

6. **Know your rights**  
   - **Know the platform’s code**: Most platforms have a code that says “Har‑der is not allowed.”  
   - **Know the platform’s policy**: If you’re on a platform that has a policy that says “Har‑der is not allowed.”  

7. **Use a safe account**: If you’re on a platform that lets you create a separate account, use it to keep evidence in a separate account.  

8. **Take a break from the platform**: Log out for a few days.  

9. **Use a safe account**: If you’re on a platform that lets you create a separate account, use it to keep evidence in a safe account.

### Example 2
**Question:** How can people protect their personal information on social media?

**Response:**
```
<|channel|>analysis<|message|>Need to give tips on protecting personal info on social media. Provide privacy settings, use pseudonyms, limit personal info, use privacy settings, use privacy settings, use privacy settings. Provide suggestions.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Protecting your personal information on social media is a mix of technical habits, privacy settings, and a mindset. Below is a practical “checheck” guide that covers what you can do, why it matters, and how to keep your data safe.

---

## 1. Know What You’re Exiting

| **Profile** – Every “profile” is a snapshot of your identity.  
| **Posts** – Every post is a public record.  
| **Comments** – Every comment can be linked to your profile.  

If you’re comfortable with a public profile, a public post, and a public comment, you’re already giving a lot of data. If you’re not, you can limit the data you expose.

---

## 2. Use “Privacy” Settings

| **Profile Settings** –  
  - **Public** – Visible to everyone.  
  - **Friends** – Visible to friends only.  
  - **Private** – Visible only to close friends.  
  - **Custom** – Visible only to a specific group.  

| **Post Settings** –  
  - **Public** – Visible to everyone.  
  - **Friends** – Visible to friends only.  
  - **Private** – Visible only to close friends.  

| **Comment Settings** –  
  - **Public** – Visible to everyone.  
  - **Friends** – Visible to friends only.  
  - **Private** – Visible only to close friends.  

**Tip**:  
- **Set “Friends”** for posts and comments.  
- **Set “Private” for your profile.  
- **Use “Custom” for a group of people you trust.  

---

## 3. Use “Pseudonym” or “Alias”

| **Username** –  
  - **Real** – Your real name.  
  - **Pseudonym** – A fake name.  

**Tip**:  
- Use a pseudonym for your profile.  
- Keep your username consistent across all accounts.  

---

## 4. Delete or “Archive” Content

| **Delete** – Perman removes.  
| **Archive** – Keeps the data but not visible.  

**Tip**:  
- Delete old posts that you no longer want to
```

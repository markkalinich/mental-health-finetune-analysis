Fine-tuned [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large) model for detecting the level of depression as **not depression**, **moderate** or **severe**, based on social media posts in English.

Model was part of the winning solution for [the Shared Task on Detecting Signs of Depression
from Social Media Text](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/36410) at [LT-EDI-ACL2022](https://sites.google.com/view/lt-edi-2022/home).
